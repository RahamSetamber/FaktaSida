            Meerkats are small carnivorous mammals that belong to the mongoose family. They are known for their slender bodies, long tails, and distinctive markings around their eyes. Meerkats are also social animals that live in large groups known as mobs or clans. These groups work together to hunt for food, protect each other, and raise their young.

                    <strong>Meerkats</strong> have a unique way of protecting themselves from predators. When a meerkat spots danger, it lets out a high-pitched alarm call to alert the rest of the group. The other meerkats will then stand on their hind legs and look out for potential threats while the first meerkat goes to investigate. This behavior is known as "sentinel behavior" and allows the meerkats to better protect themselves from predators.
